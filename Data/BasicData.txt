1 OPERATIONS SUMMARY 

1.1 Rig Mobilisation and Rig Up 

The Maersk semi-submersible drilling rig “Kan Tan IV” came on contract to Tap Oil Ltd for 
the Craigow-1 well at 14:30 hrs on 22nd December 2010, when the rig was under tight tow 
from previous well Silvereye-1 (Origin). The rig completed the tow at 22:00 hrs on 22nd 
December 2010 and began anchor running operations which were completed at 15:30hrs 
on the 23 December 2010 when all eight anchors had been run and cross tensioned. 

 

The rig was ballasted down to an operational draft of 19.8 m (65 ft), with the final rig 
position at 2.22 m from the intended location which is within the specified tolerance of 10 m 
radius. The ROV was launched and a seabed survey was conducted. 

 

The Kan Tan IV rig elevation was 26m from Rotary Table to sea level. Water depth was 
recorded as 74 m MSL. 

 

1.2 Craigow-1 Drilling Operations 

 

1.2.1 36” Hole Section and 30 x 20” Conductor 

The 36” x 26” drilling BHA was made up comprising a 26” Smith XR-VCPS milled 
tooth bit and a 36” hole opener which was run in to tag seabed at 100mMDRT. The 
36” hole was then drilled from 100mMDRT to section TD at 159mMDRT in 1.5hrs. 
The first 10m was drilled with PHG mud then drilling continued to 159m with sea 
water while pumping 50bbls PHG pills every 15m and spotting PHG around the 
BHA on connections. At section TD a 100bbls hi vis pill was pumped around and 
the well was displaced to 360bbl of 8.6ppg PHG mud. A final Anderdrift survey 
taken at section TD recording 0.5° before the BHA was pulled out of hole to run the 
conductor. 

 

The 30” x 20” shoe joint was made up before running the conductor string inside 
the PGB in the moonpool. The conductor string was landed and latched inside the 
PGB. The HAC control lines were connected and checked. Guidelines were 
attached to the guideposts on the PGB and the assembly was run in hole on drill 
pipe to 157mMDRT where circulation was established. 

 

Cementing lines were rigged up and tested before the 30” conductor was cemented 
with 264 bbls of 15.8 ppg Class G cement slurry and displaced with 39 bbls of 
seawater. The ROV observed returns throughout the cement job, with no obvious 
signs of cement or mica at the seabed. Subsequent to waiting on cement for 4 hrs 
the wellhead housing running tool was released and pulled out of hole. 

1.2.2 17 ½” Hole Section and 13 3/8” Surface Casing. 


A 17.5” Smith VR+VEJ3PS milled tooth bit was made up to a BHA including MWD 
with directional and GR sensors. The BHA was run in the hole and tagged top of 
cement (TOC) at 150mMDRT. The 17.5” hole was then drilled from 159m to 
section TD at 745 m MDRT with sea water and PHG pills (70 bbls of Hi Vis Guar 
Gum sweeps at half stand and 70bbls of Hi Vis PHG around the BHA on 
connections). At section TD 100 bbl of Hi-Vis PHG and 100bbls of Guar Gum Hi- 
Vis sweeps were circulated and the well was then displaced to 1000 bbls of 9.0 ppg 
PHG mud prior to pulling out of hole to surface. The 17.5” hole section was drilled 
from 159m to 745mMDRT (586m section) in one run, in a total of 18 hrs with an 
average ROP of 32.5 m/hr. 

 

A two joint shoe track was made up and the 13 3/8” casing was run to a setting 
depth at 735m MDRT. The surface lines were pressure tested with the cementing 
unit to 3000 psi. At that stage the cement unit hose failed on the additive system 
and a temporary repair was made to continue the operation and. An 80 bbls 
seawater spacer was pumped before the 380bbls of 12.5ppg lead slurry and 
104bbls of 15.8ppg tail slurry was pumped. The 18 ¾” wellhead running tool was 
released and the running tool was pulled out of hole to surface in preparation to run 
BOP’s. 

 

 

1.2.3 Run BOP’s 

The riser double was prepared and BOP stack was skidded to the well centre when 
operations were suspended due to high wind. After waiting on weather for 9 hours, 
the riser double was made up to the BOP stack. The stack was run and landed out 
on the wellhead and a 50 Klbs over-pull test was performed. The BOP connector 
and the 13 ¾” casing were successfully pressure tested against the blind shear rams 
to 2500psi. The BOP had previously been pressure tested on the test stump. The 
BOP landing joint was then laid out and the Diverter was installed. 

 

 

1.2.4 12 ¼” Hole Section 

A 12 ¼” BHA was made up with a Reed Hycalog RSR616M PDC bit, Sperrydrill 
motor with 0.78 deg bend, MWD tools with DIR-GR-RES sensors. The BHA was 
run in the hole and TOC was found at 696m. The cement was drilled with sea 
water and Guar Gum Hi-Vis sweeps to 732m, at which point the well was displaced 
to 9.8ppg KCL PHPA mud while drilling cement to 735m (shoe depth). The rat hole 
was cleaned out to 745m and 3m of new formation was drilled to 748m prior to 
pulling the BHA into casing shoe to perform a LOT (14.9ppg EMW). 

 

The 12 ¼” section was then drilled from 748 to 1311mMDRT. While drilling a 
dolomite stinger at 1266mMDRT, the ROP dropped to 10-15m/hr and did not 
increase again when bit was went back into shale. Drilling parameters were varied 


in an attempt to increase the ROP with no improvement. 45bbls of Steelseal pill 
(20lbs/bbls) was pumped in an attempt to clear possible bit balling with (no effect). 

The decision was made to make pull ut of hole. While pulling out at 1243mMDRT a 
tight spot was observed requiring 55 Klbs over-pull and the well swabbing. From 
that depth it required was neccesary to pump out of hole to the casing shoe. At the 
casing shoe the well was circulated the BHA was pulled ouf hole to surface. Once 
at surface the bit was graded 2-6-LT-N-X-I-CT-PR, having drilled from 745 to 
1311mMDRT (566m of formation) in 13.5hr on bottom (19hr IADC time) with an 
average on bottom ROP of 41.9m/hr. 

 

The bit was changed to a Reed Hycalog RSR516S PDC and the BHA was run back 
to bottom (washed through two tight spots at 756 and 784mMDRT. Drilling 
continued to well TD at 1800mMDRT without problems. 

 

At section TD, the well was circulated clean and the BHA was pulled to surface 
(pumping out from 1655 to 1300mMDRT due to high drag). At surface, the bit was 
graded 1-6-WT-T-X-I-ER-TD, having drilled from 1311 to 1800mMDRT (489m) in 
12.9hr on bottom (IADC drilling time 17.5hr) with 37.9 m/hr on bottom ROP. 

 

The following wireline suite was run: 

 

Run #1: PPC-MSIP-HRLA-SP-PEX 

 

While running in the hole, the tool string hung up at 1762mMDRT. Several 
attempts were made to pass that depth without success, and section was logged 
up to the casing shoe. 

 

1.3 Plug and Abandon here I am addind stuck pipe 

The well was plugged and abandoned as per the well schematic in Figure 3. 

 

Craigow-1 was abandoned with three (3) cement plugs set in the well. A 2 7/8” cement 
stinger, consisting of 19 joints of tubing and mule a shoe was made up to 5” drill pipe and 
run in hole to 1370mMDRT. A 94 bbl, 11 ppg hi-vis pill was spotted from 1220 to 
1370mMDRT to support abandonment plug #1. Plug #1 was set across the interval 1070 - 
1220mMDRT with 94 bbls of 15.8 ppg Class G cement. 

 

The cement stinger was pulled to 920mMDRT and a 94bbl, 11ppg hi-vis pill was spotted 
from 770 to 920mMDRT to support cement plug #2. Cement plug #2 was set across the 
casing shoe from 576 (tagged) to 770mMDRT with 94bbls of 15.8ppg Class G cement. 
The cement stinger was pulled to 540mMDRT and casing above the cement plug was 
displaced to inhibited 10ppg KCL PHPA mud. The plug was tagged with 10Klbs and 
pressure tested to 1000psi for 10min after 8hr waiting on cement. 


 

An 82bbls, 11ppg inhibited hi-vis pill was spotted from 380 to 230mMDRT to support 
cement plug #3 which was set from 230m to 130mMDRT with 50 bbls of 15.8 ppg Class G 
cement with a top of cement at set 30m below seabed. Excess drill pipe were laid out and 
the wellhead was jetted prior to pulling the BOPs. 

 

The Dril-Quip Hydraulic Abandonment Connector (HAC) was functioned using the ROV 
while rigging down the riser handling equipment. The 30” x 20” casing cutting assembly 
was then run to the wellhead. The assembly was latched into the wellhead and the 13 3/8” 
casing was cut at 111.4mMDRT. The PGB, wellhead and casing stump was then 
successfully recovered to surface. 

 

The ROV performed a seabed clearance check offline prior to commencing rig move 
operations. 

 

After completing the abandonment operations on the well, the rig was handed over to the 
Consortium to offload all 3rd party equipment in preparation for the rig demobilisation. 

 

1.4 Pull Anchors and Move Off Location 

After finishing with ballast tank repairs (as a preparation for the long tow), and backloading 
all equipment from the rig, the anchors were retrieved. The anchor retrieval operations 
were completed at 14:30 hrs on the 7th of January 2011. 67.5hrs were subtracted from 
that time to reflect true well operations time. The end of Craigow-1 well operations was at 
19:00 hrs on the 4th of January 2011.

3 FORMATION EVALUATION 

3.1 Mudlogging 

3.1.1 Mudlogging 

Geoservices provided mudlogging, formation evaluation and monitoring of drilling 
parameters from spud. Full mudlogging services, including cuttings collection and 
gas detection were provided from first returns (745mMD) to total depth using a high 
speed gas chromatograph system (Reserval). 

 

The mudlog, gas log, drill log and pressure logs recording lithology, penetration 
rate, mud gas, drilling and other data were prepared and are contained in Enclosure 
1, 2, 3 and 4 of this report and the Geoservices Final Well Report is contained in 
Appendix 5. 

 

Geochemical and isotope logging were provided from first returns (745mMD) to total 
depth using FLAIR logging services. The FLAIR service was employed on the well 
for quantitative gas acquisition in the C1-C5 range, determination of any fluid 
variation and/or fluid contacts to better locate eventual pay zones within the 
investigated intervals, establish typical fluid signatures to correlate to offset wells 
and to monitor for the presence of Ethene, if any, generated by drilling / bit artifact. 

 

The FLAIR log is contained in Enclosure 5 of this report. The Geoservices Final 
FLAIR evaluation report is contained in Appendix 9. 

 

3.1.2 Ditch Cutting Samples 

Cuttings were collected and described from 745mMD (first returns) to TD at 
1800.0mMD. The sampling intervals are described in Appendix 5, Section 2.5. The

Two sets of washed and dried cuttings samples were delived to Mineral Resources 
Tasmania and Geoscience Australia respectively. A third set of washed and dried 
samples, along with a set of lightly washed cuttings and a set of Samplex Trays was 
sent to Core Laboritories Australia Pty Ltd (Perth) for storage. 

 

One set of 3 Isotubes with surface collected (atmospheric pressure) gas samples 
from 1250m, 1350m and 1507m has been stored at Core Laboritories in Perth. 

 

3.1.3 Hydrocarbon Indications 

Craigow-1 was drilled with seawater and high viscosity Bentonite sweeps in the 36” 
and 16” hole sections with no returns. The 12 ¼” hole was drilled with a KCl / 
Polymer mud system. Gas was monitored from first returns at 1886mMD and 
significant peaks and breakdowns are recorded in Appendix 5, Section 3.6 and on 
the Mudlog and Gas Ratio Logs (Enclosures 1 and 2). 

 

Geoservices FLAIR Fluid and Isotope Logging with analysis in real time was 
employed on Craigow-1. However due to equipment shortfalls coupled with the 
very low gas levels detected in the well, no conclusions could be made. The FLAIR 
log is contained in Enclosure 5 of this report. And the Geoservices Final FLAIR 
evaluation report is contained in Appendix 9.

3. Executive Summary 

 

Craigow-1 exploration well was drilled by the operator Tap Oil Limited (Tap) in Permit T/47P in the 
Bass Basin, Tasmania. The objective of the well was to drill and evaluate the sandstone 
reservoirs of the Eastern View Coal Measures (EVCM). The well was drilled to a total depth of 
1,800 m MDRT but no hydrocarbons were found. 

 

The Maersk semi-submersible drilling rig “Kan Tan IV” came on contract to Tap for the Craigow-1 
well at 14:00 hrs on 22 December 2010, on completion of the previous well Silvereye-1 (Origin 
Energy). The well was spudded at 03:00 hrs on the 24 December 2010. The well was spudded in 
74m (MSL) of water with the rotary table elevation at 26 m above sea level. 

 

The 36in conductor hole was drilled to 159 m MDRT and the 30in conductor with a 20in shoe was 
run to 157 m MDRT and cemented to sea bed. The 17.5in surface hole was drilled to 745 m 
MDRT with returns to sea bed. The 13.375 casing and 18.75in wellhead was run to 735 m MDRT 
and cemented to sea bed. The BOP stack and riser were successfully run and landed onto the 
wellhead. The 12.25in hole was then drilled to well TD at 1,800m MDRT (1799.8m TVDRT) with 2 
bit runs. 

 

One logging run was performed at TD to evaluate the formation. The following logging suite was 
run: PPC-MSIP-HRLA-SP-PEX 

 

The well was subsequently plugged and abandoned with three (3) cement plugs according to 
regulatory requirements. Operations on Craigow-1 were completed at 14:30 hrs on 7 January 
2011, with the rig on tight tow to Western Port, Melbourne. 2.81 days were subtracted from that 
date to reflect actual well time and account for time spent to backload all equipment and prepare 
the rig for a tow at the end of Kan Tan IV Consortium campaign. 

 

The total time spent on Craigow-1 was 13.21 days, compared with the total AFE time for the well 
of 19.0 days. The well duration was 5.8 days (30.5 %) under the AFE. 

 

Of the 13.21 days spent on Craigow-1 a total of 0.5 day (3.8 %) of operations were recorded as 
non-productive time (NPT) for the well, 0.38 days (2.8 %) due to waiting on weather and the 
remaining 0.12 days (1 %) was due to other reasons. 

 

At the time of writing this end of well report the final cost for Craigow-1 is estimated to be US$ 
12.22 million against the AFE estimate of US$17.43 million which is US$5.21 million (29.9%) 
under the AFE.
