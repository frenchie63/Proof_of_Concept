Globex Far East Well Completion Report Barramundi-l 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Barramundi-l was drilled as a vertical exploration well in the Bass Strait inside 
Tasmanian state waters during September and October 1999, on licence number T-27-P. 
The well was drilled with the Sedco 702 Semi-submersible which mobilised from the 
Esso Turum 7 location in the Gippsland Basin to Barramundi-l in a three-day tow. The 
operator Globex Far East, based in Houston, Texas, contracted Kelly Down Consultants 
as Project Managers. The well was managed from Sydney with logistics run locally from 
Melbourne, Victoria. The primary target for the well was an anomaly horizon in the 
Eastern View section at 1337 m SS. 

2.0 WELL HISTORY 
The well spudded at 04:00 hrs on 24 th of September after a three day tow from the 
offshore Gippsland Basin. Barramundi-l reached total depth of 2100m at 0215 hrs 

on Saturday 2 nd of October, a total of 190.25 hrs or 7.93 days. The well had a 
prognosed TD of 1774 m RT, however Globex approved the deepening of the well to 
ensure all possible targets had been drilled. Anchors were pulled on 7 th of October with 
the rig off hire at 0230 hrs on Thursday 7 th October. The total hire period was 329.5 hrs 
or 13.73 days. 

2.1 Location Data

3.2 Operations Summary 
3.2.1 Logistics and Planning 
Kelly Down Consultants provided the Project Management service on Barramundi-l. The 
well was planned in conjunction with Globex personnel as a vertical exploration well. An 
application to drill was made to the department of Mineral Resources Tasmania, which 
had technical support from the DNRE Victoria. A Safety Management System was 
developed in conjunction with Sedco and approved by Tasmanian Mineral Resources. 

3.2.2 Site Survey 
Racal performed a site survey in the summer of 1999. No shallow gas indications were 
observed and no seabed obstacles for mooring. 

3.2.3 Mobilisation 
The Sedco 702 was mobilised from the Esso Turum-7 well location at the following 
coordinates: 

Latitude 380 15' 52.3" S 
Longitude 1480 15' 49.2" E 

The tow route to Barramundi-l was a distance of 156 nautical miles. A differential GPS 
system was used to confirm the position of the rig at Turum 7 and at Barramundi. The 
tow Vessels M.V. Pacific Shogun and M.V. Pacific Challenger, both 9000 BHP, with a 
bollard pull of 110 tons each were used to tow the rig to the location. The rig departed 
Turum 7 on 20/09 at 1800 hrs and arrived 2.7 days later at 11:30 hrs on 23/09. Eight 

anchors were run and pre-tensioned to 350 kips, which was completed in 14.5 hrs by 
0200 hrs on 24/09. The rig was ballasted down to drilling draft and the final position 

check made on the location at Barramundi-1:

3.2.4 Pre-spud 
A pre-spud meeting was held in Melbourne on Tuesday 7 th September. Representatives 
from Mineral Resources Tasmania and DNRE were present as well as representatives 
from the major service companies on the well. The well design was described in outline, 
and the Safety Management System which had been put in place for the well together 
with the materials movement procedures were also defined. 

3.2.5 36" Hole Section 
A shallow gas contingency meeting was held on the rig prior to spudding, followed by an 
ROV on bottom survey. Seabed conditions were found to be flat with a sandy/silt type 
bottom. The seabed was tagged with the drill string at 102.5m and the well spudded at 

04:00 hrs on 24/09/99. The BRA included a 26" DSJC bit with a 36" hole opener. The 
BRA was stabilised with an auger type 36" aD stabiliser. A float sub was placed in the 
BRA immediately above the hole opener. One stand of 9 1/2" collars was crossed back to 
one stand of 8 1/4" DC's. A seawater drilling fluid was used with pre-hydrated gel 
sweeps, and the hole drilled to 147 m in 0.5 hrs. After circulating a viscous sweep, a 
Totco survey was dropped in the BRA which showed a hole angle of 10 at 143 m. After 
washing to bottom a 250 bbl viscous pill was spotted on bottom to stabilise the hole, prior 
to running casing. 
Four joints of 30" casing were run on the Dril-Quip SS-lO permanent guide base, with the 
shoe joint being a 20" x 30" transition joint. This configuration was used to improve the 
quality of the cement job across the shoe. The casing was cemented with 600 sxs (100% 
excess) of class G cement at 1.9 sg. The ROV confirmed the guide base angle as 0.75 
degrees to port on the bull's eye. The running tool was released and recovered back to 
surface. 

3.2.6 17 1/2" Hole Section 

The 17 1/2" section was drilled through the Torquay group, a mixture of limestone and 
claystone with some interbedded sandstone. A seawater mud system was used with pre


hydrated gel to flocculate the mud. Caustic and lime were added to reach the hi-vis 
requirement of 100 sec/qt funnel viscosity. The interval was drilled including the 30"/20" 

shoe track in 22 hours with a 17 1/2" tri-cone bit to a total depth of 875 min 22 hours 

with a type 1-1-5 Tri-cone. Viscous sweeps were pumped mid stand and 25 bbl pills 

spotted on bottom when making a connection to clean the hole and help maintain hole 

stability. Totco surveys were dropped at regular intervals. At 875m hole angle was a 

maximum 2.5 degrees during the section but 0.5 degrees at casing point. 

WCRBARAI

Globex Far East Well Completion Report Barramundi·l 

The 13 3/8" casing was run in the hole without problems, on the 183/4" subsea housing. 
A total of 65 joints were run including 3 joints comprising the shoe/intermediate and float 
collar joints. After landing the wellhead housing an overpull of 50 k confirmed a latch 
down. The casing was cemented with a lead slurry of 1067 sxs class G at 12.8 ppg, 
followed by 410 sxs of tail slurry at 15.9 ppg. No indication of displacing dart shear out 
was observed, nor of a plug bump. The displacement was calculated on theoretical plus 
50% of the shoe track volume. No backflow occurred after breaking off the cement hose. 

The bop's were run and tested as per programme. 

3.2.7 12 1/4" Hole Section 

A 60 ft pendulum assembly was used to drill out the 13 3/8" casing using seawater with a 
Smith steel body 5 bladed bit. The top cement plug was encountered at 728 m, approx 
130 m high due to the plug by-passing on the 13 3/8" cement displacement. The plug was 
pushed to the top of the float collar at 843 m. After drilling the shoe track and 3 m of 
open hole, the well was displaced to a 6% KCUPolymer mud system. An FIT was 
performed to 14.3 ppg EMW. The section was drilled from 878 m to 1672 m ,without 
incident before the bit was pulled. The bit run produced an average ROP of 20.5 m1hr, 
and terminated in a typical Eastern View section comprising interbedded siltstone, sands 
and coal beds. The bit when recovered to surface had virtually the entire blade thickness 
worn down to the body OD along 60% of the blade length. A more aggressive 9 bladed 
bit (Smith Geo M34 VX) was run to cope with the interbedded and hardening nature of 
the Eastern view formation, plus an additional stabiliser on the BHA. This bit drilled a 
total of 428 m to TD at 2100 m, and was in good condition at the end of the section. 

The well was deepened from the prognosed TD of 1777m in response to the geological 
events encountered, and the desire on the part of Globex to ensure that all potential target 
horizons had in fact been drilled. 

3.2.8 12 1/4" Section Logging 

A full suite of logs was run to evaluate the section. No sidewall cores or RFT's were run. 

No hole problems were experienced running logs. 

3.2.9 Well Abandonment 
The well was abandoned as a dry hole with 5 cement plugs set to completely seal any 
permeable and porous formations. Three plugs were set in the open hole, one set across 
the 13 3/8" shoe and the fifth plug was set at surface. The wellhead was recovered by 
cutting through the 20" crossover joint below the 18 3/4" housing and the 30" casing, at a 
point 3m below the seabed. A clearance survey was performed with an ROV immediately 
after the cut.

3.3.4 Bottom Hole Assemblies 
Only 4 BRA's were run to drill Barramundi-l. The 36" hole was drilled using a 26" bit 
and 36" hole opener. This gave a 5 m 26" diameter pocket for the 20" shoe on the 30" 
casing string, thus creating a smaller annulus and giving a better cement job at the shoe. 
The 17 112" hole was drilled with one bit. The 12 1/4" hole would have been drilled in 
one run but the interbedded coal Isilt/sand sequences in the Eastern View proved too hard 
and abrasive for the Smith S91 PDC, which ringed out at 1672m.

3.6 Drilling Fluid Recap 
The Drilling Fluid details are found in the mud completion report, Appendix 2. A water base mud 
system was used to drill the well. Non reactive shales were encountered requiring minimal mud 
composition changes. 

3.7 Abandonment Summary 
The details of the abandonment for BARRAMUNDI-1 are shown in abandonment status 
diagram, fig 3.2. The well was abandoned with three cement plugs in the open hole 
sealing off any porous and permeable formations. A plug across the 13 3/8" casing shoe 
was set in place after two attempts and a final plug set at surface, immediately below 
where the casing was cut. The permanent guide base and 18 3/4" wellhead was recovered 
in the cut and pull operation, leaving the seabed clear to a depth of 3 m below the surface. 

Over 30 hours rig time was lost during the abandonment operation due to a failed casing 
cutting tool. This was the subject of a separate incident report. The casing was finally cut 
using the intended tool which had been flown over from Perth.

Report No: 1 Date: 05 OCT 1999 PreDared Bv: Colin Stuart 
Well: BARRAMUNDI 
BARRAMUNDI-1 
Operator: GLOBEX Rig: SEDCO 702 
INCIDENT/LESSON 
Failure to cut 30" casing first time 
WELL DATA/OPERATIONS PRECEEDING INCIDENTILESSON 
Well had been abandoned with 5 cement plugs and BOP's retrieved 
EVALUATION OF INCIDENT (Cause, were procedures/orders followed?, 
The cause of the incident was the replacement of the selected tool by the contractor for an inferior 
version, supplied by third party. This replacement took place since the original tool at the start of 
operations was undergoing repair work. 
Poor communication on the part of the supplier to the operator was the cause of the incident. 
REMEDIAL WORK CARRIED OUT 
The failed cutter was eventually replaced with the originally contracted tool after it was flown to the site 
from Perth. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Remind suppliers at the outset of operations ( pre-spud meeting) to advise operator of any changes to 
equipment supplied before it occurs.
